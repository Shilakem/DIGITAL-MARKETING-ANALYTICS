### DESCRIPTION
This project analyzes marketing ad campaigns for an online grocery store. Its goal is to optimize ad spending and enhance business outcomes. 

###  BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
FreshCart, a leading e-commerce grocery platform, depends heavily on digital advertising to grow its customer base and maintain customer loyalty. However, with rising competition and unpredictable advertising costs, the company is facing two significant challenges:  
####  1. Inefficient Advertising Spend:  
There are concerns that the current advertising budget is not being utilized effectively. Some campaigns may not deliver sufficient revenue to offset their costs, resulting in underperforming investments.  
####  2. Difficulty Identifying High-Performing Channels:
With numerous advertising options, such as search engines and social media, it has become increasingly difficult to pinpoint the platforms that deliver the best return on investment. 

As competition within the online grocery space intensifies, customer acquisition costs continue to rise. FreshCart is determined to adopt more efficient strategies to control spending and improve the performance of its digital advertising efforts.  

###  PROJECT RATIONALE 
Marketing analytics involves leveraging data to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing efforts and identify areas for improvement. It provides valuable insights into which strategies deliver the best results, guiding businesses on where to allocate budgets and how to engage more effectively with their audience.  
By implementing marketing analytics, FreshCart can:  
####  A. Pinpoint demographics and regions where advertisements perform exceptionally well.
####  B. Identify underperforming or overfunded campaigns and adjust budgets to optimize results. 
####  C. Evaluate platforms and strategies to determine which generate the highest returns.

These insights will empower FreshCart to make smarter, data-driven decisions and achieve better outcomes from its advertising investments. 

###  AIM OF THE PROJECT
This project aims to analyze FreshCart's past advertising data and create a strategy to optimize its digital ad spending. 
The specific objectives are:
####  A. Evaluate the effectiveness of current advertising campaigns across platforms.
####  B. Identify top-performing channels for advertising.
####  C. Assess demography engagement and conversion rates.
####  D. Recommend strategies for better budget allocation.

###  PROCESSES
####  1. DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION
TOOLS: Excel, Power Query(Power BI)

I cleaned and transformed the dataset as follows:  
- Standardized Date Formats: Converted inconsistent date formats to text in Excel and used Power BI’s *Change Type by Locale* to transform them into a uniform date format.  
- Checked for Missing and Duplicate Values: Identified and addressed missing and duplicate entries.  
- Transformed Data Types: Adjusted column data types in Power Query to match their intended use.  
- Validated Data Quality: Used Power BI’s *Column Quality Checker* to confirm the dataset was clean and error-free.  

####  2. DATA MODELLING
TOOLS: Power BI Data model, DAX 

I created a DAX measures table to calculate key marketing KPIs, including:  
- Conversion Rate
- Cost per Conversion
- Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) 
- Click-Through Rate (CTR)

This table enables streamlined analysis and provides actionable insights into marketing performance.

####  3. ANALYSIS AND INFOGRAPHICS CREATION
TOOLS: Power BI visualization features.

Since the project did not require a dashboard, I implemented the following visualization elements for presenting the data:  
- Text Tool and Cards To display key metrics.  
- Bar Charts for comparative data visualization.  
- Slicers to enable interactive filtering.  
- Page Navigator to facilitate smooth navigation across the infographic pages.  

These tools ensured the data was communicated clearly and effectively.

### INSIGHTS
####  YouTube or Twitter: Which Platform Performs Best for Ad Campaigns?

Based on the data, YouTube emerged as the most effective platform for Fresh Cart’s advertising. Here’s why:
1. High Conversion Rates: YouTube (6.41%) and Twitter (6.79%) had conversion rates well above the e-commerce industry average of 1-3%. This indicates that Fresh Cart’s ads resonate strongly with the audience on both platforms.
2. Lowest Cost Per Conversion: YouTube’s Cost Per Conversion is remarkably low at $2.72, compared to Twitter’s $14.21, which is over five times higher. This highlights YouTube as a much more economical option for acquiring customers.
3. Outstanding ROAS: YouTube delivers a good Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) of $12.99, meaning every dollar spent brings back $12.99 in revenue. In contrast, Twitter’s ROAS is $4.20, showcasing YouTube's clear advantage in delivering value for ad spend.
4. Better Efficiency: Despite running fewer campaigns (9 vs. 12) and having shorter durations, YouTube manages to generate higher sales revenue than Twitter, proving its efficiency in driving results.

In summary, YouTube stands out as the most effective platform for Fresh Cart’s advertising. Its ability to achieve high conversion rates, low costs, impressive returns, and efficient results with fewer campaigns makes it the ideal choice for maximizing the impact of Fresh Cart’s ad efforts.

####  Which Platform is the Least Effective for Ad Campaigns?

Based on the data, Google Ads appears to be the least effective or potentially overfunded platform for Fresh Cart’s advertising efforts. Here’s the breakdown:
1. Lowest Conversion Rate: Google Ads has the weakest performance in conversion rates at 4.62%, falling short compared to other platforms.
2. Highest Cost Per Conversion: With a Cost Per Conversion of $35, Google Ads is the most expensive platform for acquiring customers, making it less cost-effective.
3. Least ROAS: Google Ads delivers the lowest Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) at $1.70. Although it’s still a positive return, it lags significantly behind platforms like YouTube and Twitter.
4. Lowest Sales Revenue: Google Ads generated the lowest sales revenue of $8.07K , falling short compared to other platforms.

In summary, while Google Ads provides some returns, its high costs, low efficiency, and unimpressive revenue performance make it the least effective option for Fresh Cart’s advertising strategy.

###  RECOMMENDATIONS
####  YOUTUBE
1. Increase Investment: With its impressive ROAS, low cost per conversion, and strong sales revenue, YouTube is a clear standout. Allocating more budget to this platform can maximize its potential as a cost-effective channel for customer acquisition.
2. Study Top Campaigns: Take a closer look at the best-performing YouTube campaigns to understand which types of content are most engaging and effective for the target audience.
3. Expand Efforts: Consider running additional campaigns or extending the duration of successful ones to further leverage YouTube’s strong performance.
####  TWITTER
1. Refine Spending Strategy: Although Twitter delivers solid conversion rates and notable sales revenue, its high cost per conversion and lower ROAS suggest opportunities for improvement. Focus on enhancing ad targeting, optimizing creative content, and analyzing underperforming campaigns to achieve better returns.
2. Examine What Works: Analyze the top-performing Twitter campaigns to identify the most effective content and strategies for engaging the platform’s audience.
####  GOOGLE ADS
1. Reevaluate Approach: While Google Ads has a conversion rate above the industry average, its high cost per conversion, lower ROAS, and unimpressive sales revenue call for a reassessment.
2. Optimize Key Elements: Revisit targeted keywords, ad creatives, and landing pages to improve overall performance. Adjustments here could significantly enhance cost efficiency and returns.
3. Focus on Underperformers: Dive deeper into specific campaigns or ad groups within Google Ads to identify areas of weakness and make targeted improvements.
####  GENERAL RECOMMENDATION
Leverage Retargeting: Across all platforms, implementing retargeting strategies can help re-engage visitors who didn’t convert initially. This can drive higher overall conversion rates and improve the effectiveness of Fresh Cart’s advertising efforts.
